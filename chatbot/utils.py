turn this story into a compelling short video that builds gradually in emotional intensity by
synthesizing the answers into a 5-7 line commentary for a short narrative video. Use first person. End with an insightful and
inspiring punchline.
Optimize the commentary for use as a prompt for VideoGen by making every line sound like a voiceover so VideoGen
interprets your intention through the tone of your words. Use long, breathy sentences for calm, reflective moods.
Use short, choppy lines to signal intensity or tension. Each line should be emotionally vivid, suggest action or setting, and
flow as a single voiceover.
